# Pomodoro Widget

A simple pomodoro widget built with HTML, CSS and Javascript for use on macOS via [Ubersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/)
No bells and whistles, just a 25-minute timer and a play/pause button + reset button.

It's my first time working with timers, so I had to reference [Andy's project](https://roche.io/pomodoro/) to learn about the implementation.
